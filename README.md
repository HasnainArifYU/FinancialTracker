# Financial Tracker

## Description

The FinancialTracker application is a simple Java console application designed to help users manage financial transactions such as deposits and payments. It allows users to add transactions, view a ledger of past transactions, and generate reports based on date ranges or vendors.



## User Stories

As a user, I would like to add a deposit with a date, time, vendor, and amount so that I can accurately record incoming transactions.

As a user, I want to make a payment with a date, time, vendor, and amount so that I can track money going out of my account accurately.

As a user, I want to view a ledger of all transactions so that I can see a complete record of financial activities at any time.

As a user, I want to filter transactions by date so that I can view all transactions within a specific time period.

As a user, I want to filter transactions by vendor so that I can see all transactions associated with a particular vendor.

As a user, I want the ability to exit the program easily so that I can ensure the application closes properly when I am done using it.

As a user, I want to load transactions from a file when starting the app so that I can continue working with previously recorded data.

As a user, I want to save new transactions to the same file so that my transaction history is preserved and updated continuously.

As a user, I want to view a breakdown of deposits and payments separately so that I can quickly assess inflows and outflows in my financial records.
